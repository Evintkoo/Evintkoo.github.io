                        <p>The P-53 tumor suppressor gene is one of the most extensively studied genes in cancer research, with numerous studies implicating mutations in the gene as a key driver of cancer development and progression (Soussi, T., & Wiman, K. G. 2015). The P-53 gene is a critical component of the cell cycle mechanism, responsible for regulating cell growth and division, and acts as a checkpoint for DNA damage and other cellular stresses.</p>
                        
                        <p>When the gene is mutated, it loses its ability to regulate the cell cycle, allowing for uncontrollable growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Several types of mutation have been identified in the P-53 gene, including point mutations, deletions, and insertions.</p>

                                <p>As one of the most leading causes of cancer and an essential requisite for tumor development, P-53 suppresses mitosis and cell growth to allow cell repairs of its DNA (Di-Leo, 2007).</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>P53 is contributed in cell regulators that usually abrogates its tumor suppression function, and fostering cancer cell growth (Zambetti, 2007). The process of genetic changes in its material alters the structure or number of genes or entire chromosomes called mutation (Johnsston, 2006). Mutation is a spontaneous mutation resulting from errors during DNA replication, recombinations, spontaneous lesions, and transposable elements (Vogelstein, 2000).</p>
                        
                        <p>While the significance of these mutations in cancer development has been well-established, much remains unknown about the underlying mechanisms and how these mutations affect the structure and the function of the P-53 protein. This paper aims to analyze different sequences of the P-53 tumor suppressor gene to find a common attribute using genetics algorithms in a closed environment model.</p>
                        
                        <p>By applying genetic algorithms in a closed environment model, we can gain insights into the characteristics of P-53 mutations and their potential implications in cancer development. Genetic algorithms provide a computational approach to simulate evolutionary processes, enabling us to analyze complex patterns and identify common attributes in mutated P-53 gene sequences (Eiben & Smith, 2015).</p>
                        
                        <p>Researchers used a closed environmental model to create a simulated environment that mimics the conditions within a cell. This environment includes the necessary components for DNA replication, transcription, translation, and other cellular processes relevant to the functioning of the P-53 gene. Within this controlled setting, we can observe how different P-53 gene sequences interact with cellular components and track the behavior of mutated sequences in response to various stimuli.</p>

                                <h4>SOM Clustering</h4>
                                <p>Self organizing matrix or Kohonen maps is a particular topographically organized vector quantization algorithm. This method computes a mapping from high dimensional space into two dimensional regular grid with specificity that close position in the regular grid is associated with close position in the original high dimensional space.</p>

                        <p>The result shows that there are 6 strands that have the highest correlation among the cancer leading mutations, which are "cagcc", "agcca", "cccag", "ccagg", "ttttt", "ctttt". It is shown that each of the clusters has its own unique strand characteristic, which represents their own cluster. Based on the silhouette score, it is shown that the clustering has done a decent amount of cluster separation.</p>

                                <p>Based on the trial, the result of the data shows that the silhouette score has an increasing trend from 1 by 2 to 1 by 6 matrix, and suddenly drops after the 1 by 7 matrix and the decreasing trend continues along the increasing amount of total cluster.</p>

With the small size of the matrix, all of the agents in the matrix could be considered as a cluster center, which could be shown by a histogram plot.</p>
                        
                        <p>Since this paper is a mathematical model simulation, this research could be improved by expanding the scope of the study, which includes other types of cancer. This could provide a better understanding of the general cancer leading mutation to all cancer types. Additionally, future research could implement other methods of machine learning, which would help to separate the clustering more decently, and determine better cluster characteristics.</p>
                        
                        <p>The limitation of this study is the sample size that was limited and not nature based data. It would be better to understand and represent the nature of the mutation itself. Additionally, the use of specific algorithms or methods could also introduce limitations, as different algorithms may produce different results. It is important to acknowledge and discuss any limitations in a research paper to provide context for the results and to guide future research.</p>

                        <p>Based on the result, this paper shows that there is a characteristic of cancer leading mutation that might cause the beginning mutation path to cancer. The implementation of genetic algorithms in a closed environment model has allowed us to identify specific DNA patterns associated with cancer-causing mutations in the P-53 gene.</p>
                        
                        <p>Through our clustering analysis, we identified six distinct DNA sequence patterns that appear to be strongly correlated with cancer progression. This finding suggests that certain mutation patterns in the P-53 gene may be more likely to lead to cancer development than others.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our approach demonstrates the potential of computational methods in understanding the genetic basis of cancer. By simulating the evolutionary processes of mutation within a controlled environment, we can gain insights into the complex mechanisms of cancer development that would be difficult to observe in traditional experimental settings.</p>
